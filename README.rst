lenstronomy tutorial notebooks
==============================

In this repository you can find a variety of notebooks with tutorials on how to use lenstronomy
as well as more advanced and specific example use cases.

If you are new to gravitational lensing, check also out the `mini lecture series <https://github.com/sibirrer/strong_lensing_lectures>`_ giving an introduction to gravitational lensing
with interactive Jupyter notebooks in the cloud.


Requirements
------------
The notebooks require lenstronomy release version 1.10.4.
Instructions for installing lenstronomy and its dependencies can be found in the Installation_
section of the lenstronomy documentation.

.. _Installation: https://lenstronomy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html

If you are using the GitHub branch of ``lenstronomy``, you may be a bit ahead of the notebooks.
